In this homework, you are asked to write a MATLAB program to find the distance matrix via the short path routing algorithm in the lecture notes. Please download the adjacency matrix of network A (network_A.mat that contains a 100×100 matrix named “A”) on eLearn.

<ol>

 <li>The matrix A is the adjacency matrix of a network with 100 nodes.

  <ul>

   <li>A(i,j)=1, if there is an edge between nodes i and j.</li>

   <li>A(i,j)=0, otherwise.</li>

  </ul></li>

 <li>Please use matrix A to find the final distance matrix d (Global View).

  <ul>

   <li>d(i,j) is the distance (of the shortest path) from node i to j.</li>

  </ul></li>

</ol>




Upload two files to eLearn.(Please code by matlab.)

<ol>

 <li>source code file named “code.m”</li>

 <li>result data file named “result.mat” that contains the following

  <ul>

   <li>distance matrix named “d”.</li>

  </ul></li>

</ol>

Other requirement:

<ul>

 <li>You should use “load” to get inputdata.</li>

 <li>Programs should have comments.</li>

</ul>
